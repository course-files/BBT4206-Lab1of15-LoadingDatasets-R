# 2. Classification Datasets -----
## 2.1 DATASET 1: Dow Jones Index Data Set ----

### Description ----
# In predicting stock prices you collect data over some period of time - day,
# week, month, etc. But you cannot take advantage of data from a time period
# until the next increment of the time period. For example, assume you collect
# data daily.  When Monday is over you have all of the data for that day.
# However you can invest on Monday, because you don't get the data until the
# end of the day.  You can use the data from Monday to invest on Tuesday.

# In our research each record (row) is data for a week.  Each record also has
# the percentage of return that stock has in the following week
# (percent_change_next_weeks_price). Ideally, you want to determine which stock
# will produce the greatest rate of return in the following week.  This can help
# you train and test your algorithm.

# Some of these attributes might not be use used in your research.  They were
# originally added to our database to perform calculations.  (Brown, Pelosi &
# Dirska, 2013) used percent_change_price, percent_change_volume_over_last_wk,
# days_to_next_dividend, and percent_return_next_dividend.  We left the other
# attributes in the dataset	in case you wanted to use any of them. Of course
# what you want to maximize is percent_change_next_weeks_price.

# Training data vs Test data:
# In (Brown, Pelosi & Dirska, 2013) we used quarter 1 (Jan-Mar) data for
# training and quarter 2 (Apr-Jun) data for testing.
#
# Interesting data points:
# If you use quarter 2 data for testing, you will notice something interesting
# in the week ending 5/27/2011 every Dow Jones Index stock lost money.
#
# Attribute Information
# quarter:  the yearly quarter (1 = Jan-Mar; 2 = Apr=Jun).
# stock: the stock symbol (see above)
# date: the last business day of the work (this is typically a Friday)
# open: the price of the stock at the beginning of the week
# high: the highest price of the stock during the week
# low: the lowest price of the stock during the week
# close: the price of the stock at the end of the week
# volume: the number of shares of stock that traded hands in the week
# percent_change_price: the percentage change in price throughout the week
# percent_change_volume_over_last_wek: the percentage change in the number of
#   shares of stock that traded hands for this week compared to the previous
#   week
# previous_weeks_volume: the number of shares of stock that traded hands in the
#   previous week
# next_weeks_open: the opening price of the stock in the following week
# next_weeks_close: the closing price of the stock in the following week
# percent_change_next_weeks_price: the percentage change in price of the stock
# in the following week
# days_to_next_dividend: the number of days until the next dividend
# percent_return_next_dividend: the percentage of return on the next dividend

# Transform the data as follows:
# Transform the Data using an Excel Spreadsheet
# Microsoft Excel also offers data transformation features. Navigate to the
# following menu in a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet:
#   Data > Get Data > From File > From Text/CSV

# Import the “dow_jones_index.data” file and select “Transform Data”.

# Select the following columns: “open”, “high”, “low”, “close”,
# “next_weeks_open”, and “next_weeks_close”.

# Remove the dollar sign by selecting “Replace Values” and enter “$” in the
# “Value To Find” text field and leave the “Replace With” text field empty.

# The presence of the dollar sign can make a tool like R assume that the
# variable stores a text field, yet it is supposed to store an integer.

# There is no other transformation that needs to be done.

# Select "Close & Load" and save the file (the first work sheet) as a .CSV file
# in the following location: "data/transforms/dow_jones_index.csv"

## 2.2 DATASET 2: Default of Credit Card Clients ----
### Description ----
# This research aimed at the case of customers default payments in Taiwan and
# compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among six data
# mining methods. From the perspective of risk management, the result of
# predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more
# valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible
# clients. Because the real probability of default is unknown, this study
# presented the novel Sorting Smoothing Methods to estimate the real probability
# of default. With the real probability of default as the response variable (Y),
# and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable (X),
# the simple linear regression result (Y = A + BX) shows that the forecasting
# model produced by artificial neural network has the highest coefficient of
# determination; its regression intercept (A) is close to zero, and regression
# coefficient (B) to one. Therefore, among the six data mining techniques,
# artificial neural network is the only one that can accurately estimate the
# real probability of default.

# Attribute Information
# This research employed a binary variable, default payment (Yes = 1, No = 0),
# as the response variable. This study reviewed the literature and used the
# following 23 variables as explanatory variables:
# X1: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual
#     consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit.
# X2: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female).
# X3: Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school;
#   4 = others).
# X4: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others).
# X5: Age (year).
# X6 - X11: History of past payment. We tracked the past monthly payment
#   records (from April to September, 2005) as follows: X6 = the repayment
#   status in September, 2005; X7 = the repayment status in August, 2005; . . .;
#   X11 = the repayment status in April, 2005. The measurement scale for the
#   repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month;
#   2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight
#   months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above.
# X12-X17: Amount of bill statement (NT dollar). X12 = amount of bill statement
#   in September, 2005; X13 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005; . . .;
#   X17 = amount of bill statement in April, 2005.
# X18-X23: Amount of previous payment (NT dollar). X18 = amount paid in
#   September, 2005; X19 = amount paid in August, 2005; . . .;X23 = amount paid
#   in April, 2005.

## 3.2 DATASET 4: Iranian Churn Dataset ----
### Objective ----
# This dataset is randomly collected from an Iranian telecom company database
# over a period of 12 months. A total of 3150 rows of data, each representing a
# customer, bear information for 13 columns. The attributes that are in this
# dataset are call failures, frequency of SMS, number of complaints, number of
# distinct calls, subscription length, age group, the charge amount, type of
# service, seconds of use, status, frequency of use, and Customer Value.

# All of the attributes except for attribute churn is the aggregated data of
# the first 9 months. The churn labels are the state of the customers at the end
# of 12 months. The three months is the designated planning gap.

# Attribute Information:
# Anonymous Customer ID
# Call Failures: number of call failures
# Complains: binary (0: No complaint, 1: complaint)
# Subscription Length: total months of subscription
# Charge Amount: Ordinal attribute (0: lowest amount, 9: highest amount)
# Seconds of Use: total seconds of calls
# Frequency of use: total number of calls
# Frequency of SMS: total number of text messages
# Distinct Called Numbers: total number of distinct phone calls
# Age Group: ordinal attribute (1: younger age, 5: older age)
# Tariff Plan: binary (1: Pay as you go, 2: contractual)
# Status: binary (1: active, 2: non-active)
# Churn: binary (1: churn, 0: non-churn) - Class label
# Customer Value: The calculated value of customer
